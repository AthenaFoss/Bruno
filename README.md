## Build your CLI tool
```
cargo build --release
```

## Install your CLI tool globally
```
cargo install --path .
```

## After installation, you'll be able to run:
```
bruno init my-project
```

And it will create a new Rust project with:

A basic project structure (models, controllers, views, utils)
Pre-configured Cargo.toml with common dependencies
Sample module files and a main.rs file
Basic configuration files (README.md, .gitignore, bruno.json)
